# In-Memory-Notepad (project on Hyperskill)

### Learning outcomes

Create a simple in-memory database that supports CRUD operations. You will work with slices, loops, string formatting, standard IO and the bufio scanner.

Every day we face a shower of information that pours on us from everywhere. It's easy to forget the most important things in that flow. In this project, you'll create a simple notepad. It won't be able to store the data on the hard drive; it is one of the simplest, yet a practical program, suitable for beginners.
